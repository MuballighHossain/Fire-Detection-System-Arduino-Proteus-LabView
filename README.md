# Fire-Detection-System-Arduino-Proteus-LabView
A Smart Fire Detection System; implemented and simulated using Arduino IDE, Proteus and LabView. In the project, we used Flame and Smoke sensors in order to detect the presence of a fire, which then initiates an alert system by the utilization of a Buzzer and two LEDs.
